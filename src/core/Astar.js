        A* (pronounced "A-star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, which is the process of finding a path between two points in a graph. It is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm with the addition of a heuristic function that guides the search process towards the goal node.
        A* is an informed search algorithm, which means that it uses information about the problem domain to guide its search process. The heuristic function provides an estimate of the cost of reaching the goal node from the current node, which allows A* to make more informed decisions about which nodes to explore next.
        A* is guaranteed to find the shortest path between the start and goal nodes in a graph, provided that the heuristic function is admissible, meaning that it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal node. If the heuristic function is not admissible, then A* may not find the shortest path, but it will still find a valid path between the start and goal nodes.
        A* is widely used in video games, robotics, and artificial intelligence to find the shortest path between two points in a grid-based environment. It is also used in network routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), to find the shortest path between two nodes in a network.
        A* is a complete and optimal algorithm, which means that it will always find a valid path between the start and goal nodes if one exists, and it will find the shortest path if the heuristic function is admissible.
        A* is more efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm in many cases, as it uses the heuristic function to guide its search process and avoid exploring unnecessary nodes. However, A* may be less efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm in some cases, especially if the heuristic function is not admissible.
        A* is used in a wide range of applications, including video games, robotics, artificial intelligence, network routing, and logistics. It is a versatile algorithm that can be adapted to many different problem domains and is widely used in practice due to its efficiency and effectiveness.
