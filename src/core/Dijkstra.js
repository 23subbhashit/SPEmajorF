        Dijkstra's algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm, which finds the shortest path from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph. The algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, where the edges have non-negative weights.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is based on the principle of relaxation, where an approximation to the correct distance is gradually replaced by the correct distance.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is faster than the Bellman-Ford algorithm, as it does not consider negative edge weights. However, it is not capable of handling graphs with negative edge weights.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph, provided that the graph does not contain any negative edge weights.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is not suitable for graphs with negative edge weights, as it may produce incorrect results in such cases.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is used in network routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), to find the shortest path between two nodes in a network.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is also used in computer networks to optimize data transfer and reduce latency.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is used in transportation systems to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.
        Dijkstra's algorithm is used in logistics and supply chain management to optimize delivery routes and reduce transportation costs.
